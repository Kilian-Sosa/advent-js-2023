# Challenge 1

In Santa's workshop, the elves have a list of gifts they want to make and a limited set of materials.

The gifts are strings, and the materials are characters. Your task is to write a function that, given a list of gifts and the available materials, returns a list of the gifts that can be manufactured.

A gift can be made if we have all the necessary materials to manufacture it.

```ts
const gifts1 = ["train", "bear", "ball"];
const materials1 = "tronesa";

manufacture(gifts1, materials1); // ["train", "bear"]

const gifts2 = ["game", "puzzle"];
const materials2 = "jlepuz";

manufacture(gifts2, materials2); // ["puzzle"]

const gifts3 = ["book", "ps5"];
const materials3 = "psli";

manufacture(gifts3, materials3); // []
```
