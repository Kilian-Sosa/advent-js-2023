# Challenge 7

Santa is experimenting with new gift designs and **he needs your help to visualize them in 3D**.

Your task is to write a function that, given a size <code>n</code> (integer), **generates a drawing of a 3D gift** using ASCII characters.

The lines of the gifts are drawn with <code>#</code> and the faces with the symbol passed to us as a parameter:

```ts
drawGift(4, "+");

/*
   ####
  #++##
 #++#+#
####++#
#++#+#
#++##
####
*/

drawGift(5, "*");
/*
    #####
   #***##
  #***#*#
 #***#**#
#####***#
#***#**#
#***#*#
#***##
#####
*/

drawGift(1, "^");
/*
#
*/
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We have been told that **there is always a need to leave a newline at the end of the drawing**.
